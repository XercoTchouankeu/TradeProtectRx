                <p>TradeProtect Irrigation is a mobile application that provides the following Services to Users:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All technology, data, information, programs, materials and other Content that we make accessible to you as a User of the App;</li>
                    <li>Any other services that we may provide to you.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Services do not include User Content - your data, information, content, or other materials or information of any type that you upload to the App or otherwise provide to us. User Content is discussed more below.</p>

                <p>TradeProtect reserves the right, at any time and from time to time, temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, to: modify or discontinue the App with or without notice; limit the App's availability to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose; charge fees in connection with the use of the App; modify and/or waive any fees charged in connection with the App; and/or offer opportunities to some or all users of the App. You agree that neither we nor any affiliated entity shall be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the App, in whole or in part, or of any service, software, submission, feature, product or other Content offered through the App. You agree that these Terms will apply to any changes or updates to the Services. TradeProtect will notify you of any change to the Services that reduces its functionality or features in any material respect or if it discontinues any Service and is not replaced by a substantially equivalent function or feature. If TradeProtect has notified you under this section, you may terminate the affected Services upon providing notice to TradeProtect.

                <h3>Accounts</h3>
                <p>Users may access the App without registering for or having a service account with TradeProtect, but the features of the App and Services may require an account with TradeProtect ("Account") and becoming a TradeProtect customer to receive all Services. A "User" is someone who accesses or in any way uses the App and/or the Services.</p>

                <h3>Username and Password</h3>
                <p>General access to the App does not require an account, but requesting safety equipment through the App may require an account. These Terms govern use of all portions of the App, regardless of registration.</p>

                <p>User access of the App will require you to use a username and password. You may be required to choose a password or change your password. Remember your username and password, and do not share your username or password with anyone. Your username and password will identify you to us when you return to our App. If you forget your username or password, you may not be able to access certain portions of the App. You are solely responsible to maintain the confidentiality of your username and password and for all activities when a user is logged into the App by your username and password. You agree to immediately notify TradeProtect of any unauthorized use of your username and password or any other security breach and ensure that you log out of the App at the end of each session. TradeProtect will not be liable for damage or loss from your failure to comply with these Terms. You may be issued a new password or be required to change your password from time to time. Your username and password combination are not transferable to other users.</p>

                <p>TradeProtect reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate access to the App for any username and password combination (each, an "Account") because of inactivity or fraudulent activity under that Account, or any other reason we deem appropriate.
