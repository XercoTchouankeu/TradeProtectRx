                <h2>TradeProtectRX Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 16, 2024</p>

                <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how TradeProtectRx, LLC, an Arkansas limited liability company ("Company" or "TradeProtect") collects, uses, protects and shares personal information of users of its mobile application, TradeProtectRX (the "App") and personal information provided by users to the App.</p>

                <p>This Policy also details the choices users have with respect to the personal information users provide to the site and we manage. Through the App, TradeProtect provides a mobile application that allows you to easily provide information for personalized safety equipment and other equipment ("Services"). By using the Service and accessing the App, you acknowledge that you accept the privacy policies and practices set forth herein. If you do not accept these policies and practices, then you should not use the Service.</p>

                <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Users of the App, which may be Customers or Non-Customers. A Customer is a User with which we have a commercial relationship. The App is also available for download by Non-Customers that do not have a commercial relationship with TradeProtect, but some or all functionality may not be available to you unless you are a Customer of TradeProtect.</p>

                <p>We may collect, retain and process User Data for Customers and Non-Customers. User Data may include personally identifiable information and other information as explained more fully in this policy.</p>

                <h3>What We Collect & How We Use It</h3>
                <p>We respect your information, and our goal is to collect as little user information as possible while still providing a quality service to you. We receive and store information about you in a range of ways and the information you provide to us varies depending on your purpose in interacting with our Services.</p>

                <p>Most Users of our App provide information in the following ways:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Information You Give Us.</strong> We collect information from you that helps identify you, including your name, telephone number, date of birth, general location information, your email address and your employer's name, as well as other information you directly give us on our App, like the information you provide to us related to your health, like eye prescriptions.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Health information is considered sensitive information in some areas of the United States. We have more information for the rights of certain state residents later in this Policy but we want to make sure you're aware of this collection. If you do not agree to our collection of the health data you provide to the TradeProtect App, please do not use the App.</strong></li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Information Automatically Collected.</strong> We automatically log information about you and your computer or device. For example, when visiting our App, we log IP address, device information, browser information, operating system information and information about your use of and actions on our App. While you use the Services, we also collect information related to how you interact with us or how you wish to interact with us. This information allows us to update our services and learn how we can better equip the App to serve you. Finally, we may receive information from you, like a confirmation, when you open emails from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and helps us improve communications.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Information from Others.</strong> We may receive information from third parties about you if you choose to register using a social media account. We do this to provide our system with information, like your name and email address.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Use and Sharing of Personal Information</h3>
                <p>We collect your information to provide the Services to you. We also, as mentioned above, use your automatically collected information to analyze and improve our App and Services.</p>

                <p>We may additionally use your information to communicate with you. We may need to provide customer support related to our Services or to give you information about our Services and updates to the Service. You can opt out of communications from us about customer support by emailing us at <a href="mailto:tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com">tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com</a>.</p>

                <p>We do not sell or trade your personal information with others. We may share personal information as follows with third parties:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We may share personal information with your consent. For example, we provide notice to your employer that you've used the App if you request equipment that is then sent to your employer. We also may share your health information, like your prescription, to fulfill your requests for equipment requests.</li>
                    <li>We may share personal information when we do a business deal, or negotiate a business deal, involving the sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets. These deals can include any merger, financing, acquisition, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding.</li>
                    <li>We may share personal information for legal, protection, and safety purposes.
                        <ul>
                            <li>We may share information to comply with laws.</li>
                            <li>We may share information to respond to lawful requests and legal processes.</li>
                            <li>We may share information to protect the rights and property of TradeProtect, our agents, customers, and others. This includes enforcing our agreements, policies, and terms of use.</li>
                            <li>We may share information in an emergency. This includes protecting the safety of our employees and agents, our customers, or any person.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>We also share other information you provide us with others for to provide Services to you. When you use our Service, we may process and store the information that you provide us using vendors. These vendors are currently TradeProtectRX, but may change over time. Any information you provide when using our Services may be transferred, processed, and stored by our vendor companies for the purpose of providing their services to us.</p>

                <h3>Storage of Information</h3>
                <p>Your information collected through the App is processed in the country in which TradeProtect and its service providers maintain facilities. If you are based in the United States and use our App, you consent to have your data processed by TradeProtect in the United States.</p>

                <p>While no transmission of information via the internet is completely secure, we take reasonable measures to protect your personal information. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal information or other information you may transmit to our App; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, TradeProtect maintains strict administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect information from unauthorized access via our servers. Access to information is limited to those employees who require it to perform their job functions. We use industry-standard technology, including but not limited to data encryption and physical access controls to safeguard the information we collect from you.</p>

                <h3>Your Information Choices and Changes</h3>
                <p>Our marketing emails tell you how to "opt-out." If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your account and our business dealings with you.</p>

                <p>You may send requests about personal information to our Contact Information below or to <a href="mailto:tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com">tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com</a>. You can request to change contact choices, opt-out of our sharing with others, and update your personal information through your Account profile or through contacting us at <a href="mailto:tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com">tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com</a>.</p>

                <h3>Consequences of Not Providing Personal Data</h3>
                <p>You are not required to provide all personal data identified in this policy to use our App, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide personal data. In addition, if you do not provide the personal data, we may not be able to provide the full extent of the TradeProtect Services.</p>

                <h3>Information for Certain Visitors</h3>
                <h4>Children</h4>
                <p>The TradeProtect App is not intended for children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information directly from children. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com">tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com</a> if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 so that we may delete such data as soon as possible.</p>

                <h4>Visitors from Outside of the United States</h4>
                <p>We mention above that the App is hosted in the United States and our headquarters is in the United States. If you are visiting the App from outside the United States, information we collect about you will be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this Policy and applicable U.S. laws.</p>

                <p>Please note that data protection and other applicable laws of the United States may differ from the data protection or consumer protection laws in your country. By using the Service, you acknowledge and consent to transfer your information to our facilities as described in this Policy.</p>

                <p>For our international customers, any questions or concerns regarding the collected information, use or disclosure of your information should be directed to <a href="mailto:tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com">tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com</a>. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h4>Your Rights and Choices</h4>
                <p>Your privacy choices are important to us and we would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following:</p>

                <p><strong>The right to access</strong> -- You have the right to request TradeProtect disclose what personal information it collects, uses, discloses or sells. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you during the past 12 months.</li>
                    <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information.</li>
                    <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
                    <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>TradeProtect does not sell your personal information for monetary compensation. However, as described in this Privacy Policy, we may allow certain third parties, like sub-processors, obtain your information to provide services to you. Under some circumstances a transfer of personal information to a third party without monetary consideration may be considered a "sale" under California law.</p>

            <p>To submit an access request, please email <a href="mailto:tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com">tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>The right to rectification</strong> -- You have the right to request that TradeProtect correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request TradeProtect to complete the information you believe is incomplete. Our correction and completion of information is limited to personal data collected over the last 12 months.</p>

            <p>To submit a rectification request, please email <a href="mailto:tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com">tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>The right to data portability</strong> -- You have the right to request that TradeProtect transfer the personal information data that we have collected directly to you under certain conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>The right to erasure</strong> -- Some state residents also have the right to request the deletion of their personal information collected or maintained by TradeProtect. Once we receive a request for deletion and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete the personal information (to the extent required by law) we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain app functions that require your personal information to operate.</p>

            <p>If you wish to make a request for information or to delete your personal information, or for any questions about our privacy practices and compliance with state consumer data privacy laws, please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com">tradeprotectrx@areyecare.com</a>.</p>

            <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information or take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you.</li>
                <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
                <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
                <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
                <li>Comply with the state consumer data privacy laws.</li>
                <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Verifying Requests Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h4>
            <p>Only you or a person registered with your Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request.</p>

            <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. In addition, if you ask us to provide you with specific pieces of personal information, we will require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request. If you designate an authorized agent to make an access, deletion or opt-out of sale request on your behalf (a) we may require you to provide the authorized agent written permission to do so, and (b) for access and deletion requests, we may require you to verify your own identity directly with us.</li>
                <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>

            <p>If you make a request, we have 45 days to respond to you.</p>

            <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights. This means we will not deny you service, charge different prices or rates, provide a different level of service, or suggest that you might receive a different price or level of quality for service. Please know, if you ask us to delete your information or stop transferring your information, it may impact your experience using our App.</p>
